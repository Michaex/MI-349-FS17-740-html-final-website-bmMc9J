        <h3>Name:</h3>
          Engineer
        <h3>Descriptor:</h3>
          Assemble and maintain the engine
        <h3>Ages:</h3>
          29
        <h3>Who is it?:</h3>
        <pr>Engineer is an Ascended Magus of ancient Shurima, a being of arcane energy writhing in the broken shards of a magical sarcophagus.
          For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison.
          Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.</pr>

        <h3>What goals?:</h3>
          <pr>Though he revels in this freedom, when there's a threat to his friends, he'll endure anything to defend them.
          To the unknowing observer, Ekko accomplishes the impossible with ease, time and time again.</pr>
